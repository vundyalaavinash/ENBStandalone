Errors in ENB:
• If we write some text in the Notes part and click on “Save”, it is getting saved correctly.
• If we write text in Deliverables, Lessons Learned or Plan for Next week and click on “Save”, the recently written text in the Notes part is also getting deleted. And the text 
written in Deliverables, Plan for next week, Lessons Learned is deleted.
• If the text is written in more than 1 page, it is not coming the pdf. The downloaded PDF contains 4 pages by default and only 1 page is filled with Notes and the Notes written more than 1 page is not visible.
• The plan for next week that is filled in ENB is not getting generated in PDF. In the place of Plan for next week, Lessons Learned is getting filled. Below are the screen shots:
